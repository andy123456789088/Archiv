# Applications

Be careful: Both applications just supports the old format

## Setup
The setup is for installing VFS Application onto your computer. I've decided to publish the project, because you can use it to
create your own setups. For the information how it works you can look into frmMain.cs there is it written in a comment.

## VFS Application
This application is an implementation of VFS.dll. You can use it to create a VHP-File and do changes etc.
It's useful to create a file, e.g. for a setup.
