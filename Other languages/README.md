# Other languages

Currently the code of these languages just support the old format.

## QT C++
This implementation is not VFS-compliant, because it just can extract a VHP-File and nothig more.
In the future it should be updated to make it possible to use VFS in QT C++ and C++.

## PHP
This implementation is not VFS-compliant too, because it just can extract a VHP-File. But you
are able to read these VHP-files in PHP. 
In the future it should be updated to make it VFS-compliant.
